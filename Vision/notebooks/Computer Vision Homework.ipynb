    "* Select an image classification dataset of your choice. \n",
    "    * Images should be at least 100x100 size.\n",
    "    * Image datasets are can be very large and we are going to only use a relatively subset.\n",
    "        * Select Datasets that are either:\n",
    "            * Reasonable size \n",
    "                * You can download in reasonable time \n",
    "                * Small enough to not take too much space on your computer\n",
    "            * Allow you to download a subset.\n",
    "    * Some example datasets:\n",
    "        * [Big list from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=image)\n",
    "        * [Images of buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)\n",

    "* Create a new notebook for working out the data loader and augmentation (`DataLoader.ipynb`).\n",
    "    * Follow the Keras examples and this notebook.\n",
    "    * Setup the dataset for a demonstration of transfer learning\n",
    "        * Perform any cleaning necessary, like throwing out bad images. \n",
    "            * This will be specific to your dataset. \n",
    "            * You may discover a problem later, come back and eliminate the bad images here.\n",
    "        * Select at most 5 classes. Discard the rest of the data.\n",
    "        * Create a smaller subset of less 100 images per class for training and testing.\n",
    "        * Figure out how the labels are provided and create a data loader to load the data.\n",
    "            * If the images are separated into subdirectories, the example above works.\n",
    "            * If the image information is in a CSV file, easist path is to figure out the way to separate your classes into subdirectories and use the above example.\n",
    "    * Visualize the images, making sure the data loader is working properly.\n",
    "    * Create a module which holds the data loader and any other code you may need to reuse.\n",
    "* Create a new notebook to train a baseline model (`TrainBaseModel.ipynb`)\n",
    "    * Implement and train a transfer learning model, selecting a model from [Keras Built-in Vision Models](https://keras.io/api/applications/)\n",
    "    * Make sure you look make the learning curves.\n",
    "    * Save the model using `model.save()` (see [Keras Model Saving](https://keras.io/guides/serialization_and_saving/)\n",
    "* Create a new notebook to see effect of data augmentation a baseline model (`TrainBaseModelAugmentation.ipynb`):\n",
    "    * Add data augmentation.\n",
    "        * Select at least 3 augmentations that make sense for your datasets (see [Keras Image Augmentation Layers](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/image_augmentation/)).\n",
    "        * Visualize the data augmentation to make sure it's working as expected.\n",
    "    * Train the same model now with data augmentation.\n",
    "    * Save the new model.   \n",
    "    * Test if data augmentation is helping:\n",
    "        * Create a new notebook (`CompareAugmentation.ipynb`)\n",
    "        * Load the 2 models and compare the ROC curves with and without augmentation.\n",
    "* Train the three different transfer learning models (`Train-XXXX.ipynb`):\n",
    "    * Select 2 additional models from [Keras Built-in Vision Models](https://keras.io/api/applications/).\n",
    "    * Create a new notebook for the each model.\n",
    "        * Implement and train the model.\n",

    "        * Save the model using `model.save` (see [Keras Model Saving](https://keras.io/guides/serialization_and_saving/)\n",
    "    * Copy the notebook and try a different base model.\n",
    "* Compare the three models:\n",
    "    * Create a new notebook (`CompareModels.ipynb`)\n",
