    "📦 **Project Summary:**\n",
    "This feasibility study covers two parallel tabular AI projects: Version and Annum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version proposes a tabular NLP-based framework to establish a reproducible and ethical standard for data science using Python, EDA, and ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Annum extends this vision using a novel system architecture rooted in FreeBSD, Mojo, Apache technologies, and other frameworks to explore modular, secure ML systems for tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "📈 **Challenge Description:**\n",
    "Data science lacks a foundational and rigorously defined standard across disciplines. These projects aim to formalize tabular AI practices, benchmark emerging methods, and deploy interpretable, secure, and scalable systems — Version through mainstream Pythonic ML workflows, and Annum via other novel methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 **Datasets Used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "MIMIC-IV: Clinical EHR data (MIT); utilized for supervised health prediction tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "MMLU-Pro: NLP-based benchmark for LLMs and reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "HLE (Humanity’s Last Exam): A global academic benchmark for evaluating LLM generalization and subject-matter breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "🖥️ **Type of Machine Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning + Novel Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores classification tasks using supervised machine learning. The modeling focus is on both binary and multiclass classification depending on the dataset and task context + sandbox R&D.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version** focuses on binary classification utilizing the MIMIC-IV dataset, such as predicting patient mortality (`1 = deceased`, `0 = survived`). It integrates tabular NLP modeling and exploratory deep learning (EDL) for medical outcome prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annum** emphasizes a novel architecture + system-level innovation for ML pipelines. While not model-centric, it supports multiclass classification experiments within a FreeBSD + Mojo-based backend environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔬 **R&D Goal and Notes:**  \n",
    "Both models look to be trained using a Scikit-Learn + TensorFlow/Keras framework and evaluated on benchmark QA datasets (**MMLU-Pro** and **HLE**) to assess generalization and reasoning. These datasets are used for zero-shot multiclass benchmarking, while training is on project-curated data (e.g., MIMIC-IV). The goal is to explore the portability, reproducibility, and architectural flexibility of tabular NLP-based ML systems in scientific domains. PhysioNet via the Laboratory for Computational Physiology @ MIT recommend that any derivative works from MIMIC-IV be published on their platform. For research and development a formal literature review of the start of the art via the PRISMA method will be conducted with computer vision and general-purpose LLM's in mind.\n",
