    "**Project Summary:**\n",
    "This feasibility study covers two parallel tabular AI projects: Version and Annum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version proposes a tabular NLP-based framework to establish a reproducible and ethical standard for data science using Python, EDA, a proposal of a novel method exploratory deep learning, and ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Annum looks to extend this in development using a novel architecture in FreeBSD, Mojo, Apache technologies, and other frameworks to explore modular, secure ML systems for tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge Description:**\n",
    "Data science lacks a foundational and rigorously defined standard across disciplines. These projects aim to formalize tabular AI practices, benchmark emerging methods, and deploy interpretable, secure, and scalable systems — Version through mainstream Pythonic ML workflows, and Annum via other novel methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets Used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "MIMIC-IV: Clinical EHR data (MIT); utilized for supervised health prediction tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "MMLU-Pro: NLP-based benchmark for LLMs and reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "HLE (Humanity’s Last Exam): A global academic benchmark for evaluating LLM generalization and subject-matter breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematics Dataset: A collection of mathematical question-answer pairs at school-level difficulty, designed to test and train neural models on mathematical problems for problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type of Machine Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning + Novel Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores classification tasks using supervised machine learning. The modeling focus is on both binary and maybe multiclass classification depending on the dataset and task context + sandbox R&D.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version** focuses on binary classification utilizing the MIMIC-IV dataset, such as predicting patient mortality `1 = deceased`, `0 = survived` or other predictive outcomes. The goal is to integrate tabular and NLP modeling. A proposed novel method or not yet fully established metho--exploratory deep learning (EDL) will be utilized for research purposes. The final build goal(s) were medical predictive outcomes but time constraints will not allow it. So the focus of these builds are the mathematical field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annum** emphasizes a novel architecture as well + novel approaches and methods for ML pipelines. While not model-centric, the goal here is build with other technologies currently not utilized in the field of data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "**R&D Goal and Notes:**  \n",
    "Both models look to be trained using a Scikit-Learn + TensorFlow/Keras framework and evaluated on benchmark QA datasets (MMLU-Pro, HLE, and math_dataset) to assess generalization and reasoning. MMLU-Pro and HLE's datasets are used for zero-shot multiclass benchmarking. Due to time constraints, the MIMIC-IV dataset(s) will not be included in these builds. Research was pulled from Google DeepMind for the field of mathematics and this will be the prototyped models. The original model proposed will not be built upon these builds. These are new models. The goal is to explore the portability, reproducibility, and architectural flexibility of tabular and NLP-based ML/DL systems in scientific domains as well as others possibly. The researchers at PhysioNet via the Laboratory for Computational Physiology @ MIT recommend for derivative works from MIMIC-IV be published on their platform. For research and development a formal literature review of the start of the art via the PRISMA method is considered with computer vision and general-purpose LLM's in mind. Due to time constraints, the `math_dataset` will be the baseline of these builds.\n",

    "While working with real-world data, important factors and considerations are taken into account such as data privacy, data governance, and explainable AI (XAI)."
